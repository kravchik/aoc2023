https://adventofcode.com/2023

A beautiful set of interesting tasks accompanied by the merry Christmas story.

My solutions to all tasks are implemented in **Java**, in one file each.

Each class usually contains several tests: test1, and test2 are for examples; answer1 and answer2 are solutions for part 1 and part 2. Everything with asserts to catch a bug after refactorings.

## Interesting sum-ups.

### Day 1.
